# Sails

* Triton sails
* Add another reef to main
* Add reef to jib?

* Remove tent support
* Add windows
* New bolts for headsail rails
* Fix rotted part at rear on port hull
* Sand
* Lots of epoxy on stem, stern, deck braces
* Metal strips on keel
* Paint

# Navigation lights

* Under power < 12m
  * Combo red-green at bow
    * Locate on a very short pole on fore beam
  * All-around white at stern 1m above bow light
    * Locate on pole, top of outboard, combine with a flag pole?
    * Needs to be high enough or behind enough not to ruin night vision
    * Proper size for flag on Mona is 16" x 24", mounted aft or on stbd

# Cabin

* Replace bunks

* Remove seat braces, plug holes
* Canvas seats
* Stiffen cabin roof

# Beams

* Build
* Paint
* Replace all beam sockets
* THEN align hulls and install beam blocks
* Rebuild and attach end cleats
* For anchoring:
  * Add cleats to just inside hull on fore beam
  * Build a bridle leg to attach to anchor rode

# Mast

* Rebuild gaff
* Rebuild foot and masthead
* Install downhaul, halyard blocks? and cleats at foot
  * Install cleats

# Rigging

* Replace wire with fiber
  * Replace with 1/4" (6.5mm) SK-78
  * Dyneema can crush a thimble under load so use closed thimbles or sailmakers thimbles
  * Dyneema also needs needs curves with 5x rope diam radius to maintain strength
  * Antal rings or Ronstan Ropeglide rings would be great for "deadeyes"
  * Need 4 thimbles for forestay bridges
  * 5 rings for forestay, shrouds, dolphin stay - all the rings seem too small, actually get a better radius out of thimble
  * Original wire specs, breaking load:
    * 4mm for shrouds and forestay:  2000-2833 lbs
    * 5mm for forestay bridges and dolphin stay:  3100-4400 lbs
    * Dyneema is sized not for strength but to match the stretch
  * Use Brummel splice
    * Bury 72 times line diam, not including eye circumference
    * 18 inches for 1/4" line
* Replace lanyards
* Jib hanks?
  * Hanks might not fit over splices in the ends of the forestay
  * And maybe they have edges to catch fibers in stay?
  * Use soft shackles in place of hanks
    * More friction
    * Might lose them?
  * Put metal rings around forestay and clip hanks to those?

# Trailer

* Clean rust
* Paint
* Install lights, license plate
* Add telescoping beams
* Build bunks

* Shock cords for tiller bar

* Soft shackles
  * 8 jib hanks?

  * anchor chain snubber

* Sail covers
* Bags for chain and rode

Epoxy history:

  * mast head and foot
  * glued all beams
  * top fillets on all beams
  * bottom fillets on aft beam
  * bottom fillet on after side of fore beam

  * finished fillets on beams:
    * bottom fillets on forward side of fore beam, three larger gaps on each side but not in the center
    * bottom fillets on center beam
  * filled over-sized holes for hammock lines before drilling out
  * coated beams (put varnish over epoxy on the mast step)
  * glassed fore hatches
  * glued and coated angled coamings and hatch rails on main hatches


put this is Notes, duh!!
